            <h1>
                C: Group Subsets of a Set.
            </h1>
            
            <h2> 1. Prove that there is an identity element with respect to the operation \(+\), which is ________.</h2>
            <p> <u>Solution:</u> Given that \(A + B = (A - B)\cup (B - A)\), consider the empty set \(\varnothing\). Note that If we take \(B\) to be empty, then
            \( (A - B) = (A - \varnothing ) \cup (\varnothing - A) \). Using the definitions of set complement and the book's definition of the empty set (see appendix A), we have that
            \((A - \varnothing )= A\) and \((\varnothing - A) = \varnothing\), because \(A - B\) is defined in appendix A as the set of all elements in \(A\) that are not in \(B\).
            The last step leaves us with \(\ A \cup \varnothing\), using property 8 on page 348 we then have \(A \cup \varnothing = A\). 

            In the other direction: \( (\varnothing - A)  \) where \(A\) is nonempty, we have that \( (\varnothing - A) \cup (A - \varnothing ) = (A - \varnothing) \cup (\varnothing - A) = (A - \varnothing)\)
            . Because of set union commutivity, the other direction is identical to the first direction so it follows that \(\varnothing\) is the identity element of this group.
            </p>

            <h2> 2. Prove that every subset \(A\) of \(D\) has an inverse ______. Thus making \(P_D\) a group.</h2>
            <p> <u> Solution:</u> Given any subset \(A\) of \(D\), denote the complement of \(A\) by \(A^{c}\). Note then that \((A + A^{c}) = (A - A^{c}) \cup (A^{c} - A) = 
                \varnothing \cup \varnothing = \varnothing\). Since this property holds for the empty set itself as well, the inverse of any subset of \(D\) must be the complement of 
                that subset.
            </p>
            
            <h2>
               3. Let \(D\) be the Three Element Set \(D = \{a,b,c\}\). List all of the elements of \(P_D\).
            </h2>
            <p>
                <u> Solution:</u> This is equivalent to listing out the elements of the powerset of \(D\). We have the elements of \(P_D\) being:
                \( \varnothing, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a,b\}, \{b,c\}, \{a,c\}, \{a,b,c\} = D\)
            </p>
            

            <h1> D: A Checkerboard Game. </h1>
            <h2>Explain why \(\langle G, * \rangle\) is a group and write the table of \( G\).</h2>
            <p><u> Solution: </u> Using the information given in the description, the filled out table looks like this:
            \[
            \begin{array}{ c | c c c c } 
                * & I & V & H & D \\
                \hline 
                I & I & V & H & D \\
                V & V & I & D & H \\
                H & H & D & I & V \\
                D & D & H & V & I 
            \end{array}
            \]
            We obtain the table as such by first noting that any move \(M*I\) where \(M\) is any nonidentity move. Any move 
            played in succession with the identity is just the move itself. Next, we bring our attention to the vertical move \(V\).
            \(V*V\) will be the identity on this board since the board is 2 by 2. Adding one vertical move takes the "player" or "piece" to
            the edge of the board, and another vertical move requires movement, we can't leave the board so we must return to the space the piece was
            before the first vertical move.
            <br>
            For the move \(V*H\), this is identical to a diagonal move \(D\) from the starting place to the ending place after both moves. This
            is additionally given in the problem description.
            <br>
            The move \(V*D\) takes some thought, as we can move diagonally but then me must move vertically. Recall that \(V*H = D\), multiplying both sides by the inverse of 
            \(V\) we get \(H = D*V^{-1}\). We know that \(V^{-1} = V\) from the description so then \(H = D*V\).
